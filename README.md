# LXJS - Trainings

### tl;dr
LXJS has a surprise, real trainings about some of the most hot frameworks and libraries out there, our goal is to inspire, educate and motivate new community members to take the leadership with one of this bleeding edge technologies and bring them back to their communities and also take a key role on their development. How? Well that is what this repo is for :)

# Motivation - Why the heck do we want this to happen?

We've been running LXJS for two years now([2012](http://2012.lxjs.org/);[2013](http://2013.lxjs.org/), so many things have happened so far, so many new friendships, projects, ideas that bootstraped during the conference, I can't help myself looking back and not feeling nostalgic :) 

Our core goals remained the same as the day 1. LXJS is a community conference, meaning there is no company running it, we don't take sponsored talks, we don't do fancy speaker or sponsor dinners, there is no questions after the talks and we strive to break even in the end of the day, making it a non-profit conf.

Nuno Job, one of the visionaries(the other being Pedro Teixeira) behind the first edition and that brought it all together, has a really awesome blog post explaining our Mantra, I reccommend you to check it out, [here](https://medium.com/what-i-learned-building/9739289011b4).

**So, the question was, why do we want to have trainings this year as part of LXJS**. After organizing it for 2 years, attending conferences like RealtimeConf, NodeConf and other tech events, we came to realize that in order to fulfil our goal to empowering the community to become leaders, we need to expand LXJS effect to a more continuous and sustainable format. What has been happening, is that we are able to generate, with the help of the awesome JS community, a huge spike of interest, enthusiasm and activity during LXJS (a bit as the following image shows):

The reason why the huge spike happens is easily explained, however, why it fades away made us think. By attending LXJS, you get a lot of information about what is going on in the JS community, exciting stuff that comes from all the corners of the world, but until, there was no space for people to understand how this technologies work and how can they replicate, enhance and recreate all the awesomeness at home. And that is exactly what we want to bring this year, by having dedicated training blocks, where attendees will have access to experience all this sort of bleeding edge topics, they will not only learn them, but they will be able to recreate the knowledge transfer experience, improve their skills on that specific topic and bring it back to their community, in a conference or meetup. Also, we are shooting to let more people be confortable to take the lead in a specific technology, for example, by having quality time with person X which created the Y open source project, the attendee Z will understand better its guts and be able to contribute in the near future, possibly even become one of the core contributors or the leader of that technology for his local community!

We are really super excited to make this happen, thank you for taking part on it!


# Format - The vision

For this 'ritual of knowledge transfer' to happen sucessfully, we've to assure that the participants are engadged as much as we can and that their level of compression for the training topic is a bit above the basic level, so we can take advantage of the in person time to actually make it worth it.

We are super thankful for all the hard work you are putting through, in order to create something unique and that people will trully value, hoping that this will empower new leaders scatered accross other communities.


## Pre-training 

Before the conference happen, the participants of the training will have to have access to resources to get them started, such as:

* Blog posts that might help them understand what is all about
* To Do lists for download, install and set up configurations (or even accessing a remote VM with everything prepared)
* Some exercises that they can get their hands wet

## During-training 

Trainings will consist in 2:30h hours straight, each training will be formed by a class of 30~35 people in a round table set up with the training having access to a projector and a mic.

## Break-out sessions

After the training is done, the participants have two options, attend the following training, or move to the break out sessions area, where trainers and attendees meet to continue their hacking, this will give them space to dig even deeper.

## After-training 

After the training is post-LXJS, in the same communication channel used by the pre-training part, attendees will be delivered with "take home" exercises so they can go deeper on their learning.


# Process - How this is going to happen?

The process will be very simple

1. A repo will be created for each training (private)
2. Trainers will be able to push there the materials they want to make available for the participatns
3. LXJS attendees will reserve their places before LXJS and be invited to this repos (joining the repo team) where they will see stuff like the preparation todos for the training
4. Before LXJS, the repos will be set to open source, as we want other people that might take advantage from it, to do it
5. After LXJS, the same repo will be use for the take homes, where attendees will be able to put questions and get replied throught there (centralized channel of communication for each training)
